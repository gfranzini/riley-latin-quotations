Lucus a non lucendo.				"That is, Lucus, ""a grove,"" is derived, by antiphrasis, from non lucere, ""not to admit light,"" because, as the grammarians said, it does not allow the light of the sun to shine through it. This derivation is found in Servius on Aeneid I., Charisius, and Diomedes. Quintilian (i. 6) also notices it, but merely to ask whether such derivations from contraries can possibly be received by reasonable people; some critics having also imagined that ludus, ""a school,"" was so called a non ludendo, because no play was allowed in it, and that Pluto was called Ditis, ""rich,"" because he was minime dives, ""not at all rich."" Vossius condemns the derivation of lucus from luceo as a mere fancy of the grammarians, and alludes to another given by Isidore, xiv. 8, a collucendo crebris luminibus religionis causa, ""from the number of lamps or torches that were often lighted in the sacred groves,"" lucus being properly a grove consecrated to some deity, though often used in a general sense. But Vossius prefers on the whole to derive it from λόχος, "" an ambush."" Others would have it for lugus from λύγη, "" darkness."" The real etymology is quite uncertain. Servius, who favours the derivation from luceo, adduces, in support of it, another imagination of the grammarians, bellum, ""war,"" a nulla re bella, because it has nothing pleasing in it; and Varro, de L. L., book v., rather inclines to think that coelum, ""heaven,"" may be derived a celando, from ""to conceal,"" quia apertum est, ""because it is open."" Lucus a non lucendo has become proverbial in ridicule of absurd or far-fetched etymologies. See Non sequitur, and Obscurum per obscurius."
