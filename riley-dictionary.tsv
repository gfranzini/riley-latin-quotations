1177	Eques ipso melior Bellerophonte.		Horace		A better horseman than Bellerophon himself.	Bellerophon was master of the winged horse Pegasus.
1178	Equitis quoque jam migravit ab aure voluptas Omnis, ad incertos oculos, et gaudia vana.		Horace		In these days, our knights have transferred all pleasure from the hearing to the eyes that may deceive, and frivolous amusements.	The poet rebukes the Roman equites for their love of the shows of the Circus and the amphitheatre.
1179	Equo fraenato est auris in ore.		Horace		The ear of a bridled horse is in his mouth.	He is guided by the bit, not by words.
1180	Equus Seianus.				The horse of Seius.	Cneius Seius, a Roman citizen, possessed a horse of singular size and beauty, and supposed to be sprung from those of Diomedes, king of Thrace. Seius was put to death by Antony, and the horse was bought for a large price by Cornelius Dolabella. He in his turn was conquered by Cassius, and fell in battle; upon which the horse came into the hands of Cassius. He slaying himself on being defeated by Antony, the horse came into Antony's possession; who was afterwards defeated by Augustus, and put himself to death. The possession of this horse was considered so disastrous to its owner, that "The horse of Seius" became a proverbial expression for a thing that was supposed to bring ill luck.
1181	Erant in officio, sed tamen qui mallent imperantium mandata interpretari, quam exsequi.		Tacitus		They attended to their duties, but still as preferring rather to cavil at the commands of their rulers, than to obey them.	Quoted by Lord Bacon in his Essays.
1182	Erant quibus appetentior famae videretur, quando sapientibus cupldo gloriae novissima exuitur.		Tacitus		There were some to whom he seemed too greedy of fame, at a time when the desire of glory, that last of all desires, is by the wise laid aside.	Milton was probably indebted to this passage for his line on ambition, "That last infirmity of noble minds."
1183	Ergo haud difficile est perituram arcessere summam, Lancibus oppositis, vel matris imagine fracta.		Juvenal		Therefore there is no scruple in borrowing a sum, soon to be squandered, by pawning their plate, or the battered likeness of their mother.	
1184	Eripe te morae.		Horace		Away with all delay.	
1185	Eripe turpi Colla jugo. Liber, liber sum, dic age.		Horace		Rescue your neck from this vile yoke; come, say, I am free, I am free.

This line, an adaptation of one from Manilius, was inscribed by the French minister Turgot on a medal struck in honour of Benjamin Franklin. The allusion is to his discovery that lightning is produced by electricity, and to the support which he gave to his country in the assertion of its independence of the British crown. See Solvitque animis, &c.

The Pythagorean doctrine of the transmigration of the soul.
1192	Esse bonum facile est, ubi quod vetet esse remotum est.		Ovid		It is easy to be good, when that which would forbid it is afar off.	It is easy to be virtuous when we are not exposed to temptation.

1194	Esse quoque in Fatis reminiscitur affore tempus Quo mare, quo tellus, correptaque regia coeli Ardeat; et mundi moles operosa laboret.		Ovid		He remembers too that it was in the decrees of fate, that a time should come when the sea, the earth, and the palace of heaven, seized by the flames, should be burnt; and the laboriously-wrought fabric of the universe should be in danger of perishing.	So we read in Scripture, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up." 2 Pet. iii.

1196	Est amicus socius mensae, et non permanebit in die necessitatis.				Some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction.	Ecclus. vi. 10. This, however, is only said of the class of so-called friends.

1203	Est egentissimus in sua re.				He is much straitened in circumstances.	
1204	Est etiam miseris pietas, et in hoste probatur.		Ovid		Towards the wretched there is a duty, and even in an enemy it is praised.	
1205	Est etiam, ubi profecto damnum praestet facere, quam lucrum.		Plautus		There are occasions when it is undoubtedly better to make loss than gain.	
1206	Est hic, Est ubi vis, animus si te non deficit aequus.		Horace		[Happiness] is to be found here, it is everywhere, if you possess a well-regulated mind.

1211	Est modus in rebus; sunt certi denique fines, Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.		Horace		There is a medium in all things; there are, in fact, certain bounds, on either side of which rectitude cannot exist.	The evils which have been produced by fanaticism prompted by motives really good, are almost equal to those which have sprung from confirmed vice. The poet wisely commends the golden mean.
1212	Est multi fabula plena joci.		Ovid		It is a short story, but full of fun.	
1213	Est natura hominum novitatis avida.		Pliny the Elder		Man is by nature fond of novelty.

1217	Est profecto Deus, qui quae nos gerimus auditque et videt.		Plautus		There is undoubtedly a God who both hears and sees the things which we do.	
1218	Est proprium stultitiae aliorum cernere vitia, oblivisci suorum.		Cicero		It is the province of folly to discover the faults of others, and forget its own.	
1219	Est quaedam flere voluptas; Expletur lachrymis, egeriturque dolor.		Ovid		There is, in weeping, a certain luxury; grief is soothed and alleviated by tears.	
1220	Est quiddam gestus edendi.		Ovid		One's mode of eating is of some importance.	
1221	Est quoddam prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.		Horace		'Tis something to have advanced thus far, even though it be not granted to go farther.	Failure in a laudable attempt is far from being a thing to be ashamed of.
1222	Est quoque cunctarum novitas carissima rerum.		Ovid		Novelty is, of all things, the most sought after.	
1223	Est rosa flos Veneris; quo dulcia furta laterent, Harpocrati matris dona dicavit Amor. Inde rosam mensis hospes suspendit amicis, Convivae ut sub ea dicta tacenda sciant.				The rose is the flower of Venus; in order that his sweet thefts might be concealed, Love dedicated this gift of his mother to Harpocrates. Hence it is that the host hangs it up over his friendly board, that the guests may know how to keep silence upon what is said beneath it.	Harpocrates was the god of silence. Hence our expression, "It was said under the rose."
1224	Est tempus quando nihil, est tempus quando aliquid, nullum tamen est tempus in quo dicenda sunt omnia.				There is a time when nothing may be said, a time when some things may be said, but no time when all things may be said.

Lucan		Has God any other seat than the earth, and the sea and the air, and the heavens, and virtue? Beyond these why do we seek God? Whatever you see, he is in it wherever you move, he is there.	The doctrine of Pantheism.
1227	Esto perpetua.				Be thou everlasting.	The last words of Father Paul Sarpi, spoken in reference to his country, Venice.
1228	Esto quod es; quod sunt alii, sine quemltbet esse: Quod non es, nolis; quod potes esse, velis.				Be what you really are; let any other person be what others are. Do not wish to be that which you are not, and wish to be that which you can be.

1230	Esto, ut nunc multi, dives tibi, pauper amicis.		Juvenal		Be, as many are nowadays, rich to yourself, poor to your friends.	
1231	Esurienti ne occurras.				Do not encounter a starving man.	An enemy reduced to desperation is likely to prove formidable.
1232	Et caetera.				And the rest.	Denoted by — &c.
1233	Et credis cineres curare sepultos?		Virgil		And do you suppose that the ashes of the dead care for what passes on earth?

1235	Et dubitamus adhuc virtutem extendere factis?		Virgil		And do we hesitate to extend our glory by our deeds?	
1236	Et errat longe mea quidem sententia, Qui imperium credit gravius esse aut stabilius Vi quod fit, quam illud, quod amicitia adjungitur.

1240	Et genus et proavos, et quae non fecimus ipsi, Vix ea nostra voco.		Ovid		High lineage and ancestors, and such advantages as we have not made ourselves, all these I scarcely call our own.	
1241	Et genus et virtus, nisi cum re, vilior alga est.		Horace		Virtue and high birth, unless accompanied by wealth, are deemed more worthless than sea-weed.	That is, by the unthinking part of the community.
1242	Et lateat vitium proximitate boni.		Ovid		And let each fault lie concealed under the name of the good quality to which it is the nearest akin.	See Et mala, &c.
1243	Et latro, et cautus praecingitur ense viator; Ille sed insidias, hic sibi portat opem.		Ovid		Both the cut-throat and the wary traveller is girded with the sword; but the one carries it for the purposes of crime, the other as a means of defence.

1245	Et mala sunt vicina bonis; errore sub illo Pro vitio virtus crimina saepe dedit.		Ovid		There are bad qualities too near akin to good ones: by confounding the one for the other, a virtue has often borne the blame for a vice.	See Et lateat, &c.
1246	Et male tornatos incudi reddere versus.		Horace		And to return ill-polished verses to the anvil.	
1247	Et mea cymba semel vasta percussa procella Illum, quo laesa est, horret adire locum.		Ovid		My bark too, once struck by the overwhelming storm, dreads to approach the spot on which it has been shattered.	
1248	Et meae, (si quid loquar audiendum), Vocis accedet bona pars.		Horace		Then, if I can offer anything worth hearing, my voice shall readily join in the general acclamation.

1259	Et peccare nefas, aut pretium est mori.		Horace		It is forbidden to sin, or the reward is death.	The sin to which the poet alludes, is that of adultery, as punished by the Scythians. So in Scripture, "The wages of sin is death." Rom. vi. 23.
1260	Et Phoebo digna locuti, Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo; Omnibus his nivea cinguntur tempora vitta.		Virgil		Those who have uttered things worthy of Phoebus, and those who have made others mindful of them by their merits, all these have their temples bound with the snow-white fillet.	In his description of the rewards of Elysium, the poet classes his brethren, the disciples of Phoebus, with the benefactors of mankind.
1261	Et pudet, et metuo, semperque eademque precari, Ne subeant animo taedia justa tuo.		Ovid		I am both ashamed and I dread to be always making the same entreaties, lest a justifiable disgust should take possession of your feelings.	
1262	Et quae sibi quisque timebat, Unius in miseri exitium conversa tulere.		Virgil		And what each man dreaded for himself, they bore lightly, when centred in the destruction of one wretched creature.	A picture of the readiness with which man makes a scapegoat of his fellow-man.
1263	Et quando uberior vitiorum copia? Quando Major avaritiae patuit sinus? Alea quando Hos animos?		Juvenal		And when was vice ever in greater force? When was there ever a greater scope for avarice? When did the dice more thoroughly enthral the minds of men?	
1264	Et qui aliis nocent, ut in alios liberales sint, in eadem sunt injustitia, ut si in suam rem aliena convertant.		Cicero		And those who injure one party to benefit another, are quite as unjust, as if they converted the property of others to their own benefit.	
1265	Et qui nolunt occidere quenquam Posse volunt.		Juvenal		Even those who have no wish to slay another, are wishful to have the power.	In allusion to the ambitious thirst for power.

1277	Etiam celeritas in desiderio, mora est.		Publilius Syrus		In desire, even swiftness itself is delay.	
1278	Etiam fera animalia, si clausa teneas, virtutis obliviscuntur.				Savage animals even, if you keep them in confinement, forget their ferocious disposition.	
1279	Etiam fortes viros subitis terreri.		Tacitus		The minds of resolute men even may be alarmed by sudden events.	And on the other hand, weak men are then found resolute.

1826	Homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto.		Terence		I am a man, and nothing that concerns a man do I deem a matter of indifference to me.	St. Angustin tells us that on hearing these words of the poet, the theatre resounded with applause.
1827	Homo toties moritur, quoties amittit suos.		Publilius Syrus		A man dies as many times as he loses his relatives.

1831	Honesta mors turpi vita potior.		Tacitus		An honourable death is better than an ignominious life.	The maxim of a martyr.
1832	Honesta paupertas prior quam opes malae.	proverb			Poverty with honesty is better than ill-acquired wealth.	
1833	Honesta quaedam scelera successus facit.		Seneca		Success makes some crimes honourable.	Thus rebellion and conspiracy, though based on fraud and ingratitude, are dignified, if successful, with the name of "revolution."
1834	Honestum non est semper quod licet.	legal maxim			That is not always honourable which is lawful.	If every one scrupulously insisted on his legal rights, the world would De a scene of tenfold litigation. We must "give and take."
1835	Honestum quod vere dicimus, etiamsi a nullo laudatur, laudabile est sua natura.		Cicero		That which we truly call virtuous, even though it be praised by no one, is praiseworthy in its own nature.

1844	Horresco referens.		Virgil		I shudder as I tell it.	
1845	Horridus miles esse debet, non coelatus auro argentoque, sed ferro et animis fretus. Virtus est militis decus.		Titus Livius		The soldier should inspire terror, and not be adorned with gold and silver, but rely upon his courage and his sword. Valour is the soldier's virtue.	
1846	Horror ubique animos, simul ipsa silentia terrent.		Virgil		Horror seizes their minds, and the very silence is dreadful.	
1847	Hortus siccus.				"Literally, "a dry garden."	A collection of dried plants for the purpose of classification. Applied figuratively to a recital of dry and uninteresting details.
1848	Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores; Sic vos non vobis fertis aratra boves; Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes; Sic vos non vobis vellera fertis oves; Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aves.		Virgil		I wrote these lines; another has borne away the honour — Thus do ye, oxen, for others hear the yoke; thus do ye, bees, for others make honey; thus do ye, sheep, wear fleeces for others; thus do ye, birds, for others build nests.	On the occasion of some shows at Rome, the weather was remarkable for tempestuous nights, with fine days. Virgil, then a young man, and unknown, wrote these lines, and fixed them in a conspicuous place: "Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula mane, Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet." "It rains all night, the games return with day, Caesar with Jove thus holds divided sway." The author being inquired for, a poet of the name of Bathyllus claimed the distich, and was rewarded accordingly. Virgil, indignant at this, wrote under the verses the line "Hos ego, Ac.," and the words, "Sic vos non vobis," four times. He alone proving able to complete the lines, of which these words were the beginning, the imposture of Bathyllus was detected, and he was dismissed with disgrace, while Virgil obtained the credit which was his due.
1849	Hospes nullus tam in amici hospitium devorti potest, Quin ubi triduum continuum fuerit, jam odiosus siet, Verum ubi triduum continuos immorabitur, Tametsi dominus non invitus patitur, servi murmurant.		Plautus		No guest can be hospitably entertained by a friend, but what when he has been there three days together, he must become a bore; but when he prolongs his stay for ten successive days, even should the master willingly allow it, the servants grumble.

1854	Huic maxime putamus malo fuisse, nimiam opinionem ingenii atque virtutis.		Cornelius Nepos		This we think was his especial misfortune, that he entertained too high an opinion of his own genius and valour.	The character of Themistocles.
1855	Huic versatile ingenium sic pariter ad omnia fuit, ut natum ad id unum diceres, quodcunque ageret.		Titus Livius		This man's genius was so versatile, so equally adapted to every pursuit, that in whatever he engaged, you would pronounce him to have been born for that very thing alone.	The character of the elder Cato.

1861	Humanum facinus factum est. Actutum fortunae solent mutarier. Varia vita est.		Plautus		The common course of things has happened. Fortunes are wont to change upon the instant. Life is chequered.	
1862	Humiles laborant ubi potentes dissident.		Phaedrus		The humble are in danger, when the powerful disagree.	See Quicquid delirant, &c.
1863	Hunc comedendum et deridendum vobis propino.		Terence		I make him over to you to eat and drink him to the very dregs.	The figure is taken from the custom of tasting of a cup of wine, and then handing it to another.

A figure of speech in which the order of things is inverted, as in the lines of Virgil, Georg. b. iii. l. 60, and Aen. b. iii. l. 662. See also Aen. b. ii. l. 353, — Moriamur, et in media arma ruamus. — "Let us die, and rush upon their weapons."
1865	I demens! et saevas curre per Alpes, Ut pueris placeas, et declamatio fias.		Juvenal		Go, madman! run over the rugged Alps, that thou	
1866	I nunc, et veterum nobis exempla virorum, Qui forti casum mente tulere refer.		Ovid		Come now, and recount to me the examples of men of ancient times, who have endured evils with fortitude.	
1867	I nunc, magnificos, victor, molire triumphos, Cinge comam lauro, votaque redde Jovi.		Ovid		Go now, thou conqueror, acquire splendid triumphs, encircle thy brows with laurel, and pay thy vows to Jove.	
1868	I, bone, quo virtus tua te vocat; i pede fausto, Grandia laturus meritorum praemia.		Horace		Go, my brave fellow, whither your valour calls you, go with prosperous step, certain to receive the ample rewards of your merit.

1874	Ibis, redibis, non morieris in bello.				Thou shalt go, thou shalt return, thou shalt not die in battle.	This may be also read, by changing the punctuation, Ibis, redibis non, morieris in bello. "Thou shalt go, thou shalt not return, thou shalt die in battle." An ambiguous answer given by an oracle; which, as punctuation was not used in ancient times, might save the credit of the oracle either way.
1875	Ibit eo quo vis, qui zonam perdidit.		Horace		He who has lost his girdle, will go wherever you please.	Among the ancients, money, or the purse, was sometimes kept within the girdle. It is of the same meaning as our homely adage, "Hungry dogs eat dirty puddings." See Graeculus esuriens, &c.
1876	Id arbitror, Adprime in vita esse utile, ne quid nimis.		Terence		This I consider in life to be especially advantageous; that one do nothing to excess.	See Sunt certi, &c.
1877	Id cinerem aut manes credis curare sepultos?		Virgil		Do you suppose that the ashes of the dead, or the shades of the buried, care for that?	The poet's less enlightened countrymen believed, however, that ghosts ate and drank at certain periods of the year, and especially at the time of the Feralia, which they celebrated in February. See Ovid's Fasti, b. ii. l. 566, et seq.
1878	Id commune malum, semel insanivimus omnes.		mantuanus		It is a common ill, that we have all been mad once.	Ecl. i.
1879	Id demum est homini turpe, quod meruit pati.		Phaedrus		That only is really disgraceful to a man, which he has deserved to suffer.

1882	Id facere laus est quod decet, non quod licet.		Seneca		To do what is becoming, not what the law allows, is true merit.	There are many moral offences, which it is impossible to bring within the strict letter of the law, but which it is our duty to avoid equally with those which are criminal.

Terence		That is a thing that I really consider my crowning merit, to have found out the way by which a young man may be enabled to learn the dispositions and manners of courtesans, so that by knowing them betimes he may detest them for ever after.	
1888	Idem quod.				The same as.	Commonly expressed by the initials, i. q.
1889	Idem velle et idem nolle ea demum firma amicitia est.		Sallust		To have the same tastes and the same dislikes — this in fact is the basis of lasting friendship.	
1890	Idoneus quidem mea sententia, praesertim quum et ipse eum audiverit, ut scribat de mortuo; ex quo nulla suspicio est, amicitiae causa, eum esse mentitum.		Cicero		In my opinion he is qualified to write (of the deceased), especially as he had been accustomed to hear him speak; for which reason there can be no ground for suspicion, that he has, for motives of friendship, stated what is false.	
1891	Ignavis semper feriae sunt.	proverb			With fools it is always holiday.	Idle persons can always find an excuse for indolence.
1892	Ignavissimus quisque, et, ut res docuit, in periculo non ausurus, nimio verbis et lingua ferox.		Tacitus		Every cowardly fellow, who, as experience tells us, will skulk in the hour of danger, is noisy and blustering with his words and language.	The best pictures of a blustering coward are the two captains, Thraso, in the Eunuchus of Terence, and Pyrgopolinices, in the Miles Gloriosus of Plautus, both of whom are first-rate vapourers.
1893	Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.		Virgil		[The bees] drive from their hives the drones, a lazy race.	
1894	Igne quid utilius? si quis tamen urere tecta Comparat, audaces instruit igne manus.		Ovid		What is there more useful than fire? and yet, if any one prepares to burn a house, it is with fire that he arms his rash hands.	Every blessing may be abused.
1895	Ignem ne glodio fodito.	proverb			Stir not the fire with a sword.	Do not irritate an angry person, — or, as we say, "add fuel to flame."
1896	Ignis fatuus.				A deceiving light.	The Will o' the wisp, or Jack-a-lantern. These words are sometimes used figuratively to denote a false light, tending to lead men astray.
1897	Ignis sacer.		Pliny the Elder		St. Anthony's fire.	or Erisypelas. Columella calls by the same name an incurable and contagious disease among sheep.
1898	Ignoramus.				We are ignorant.	A term employed when a grand jury ignores an indictment. The word is jokingly applied to an ignorant man, a dolt.
1899	Ignorantia facti excusat.	legal maxim			Ignorance of the fact excuses.	A contract being falsely read or explained to an ignorant man, and executed by him under the false impression produced thereby, is void.
1900	Ignorantia juris quod quisque tenetur scire neminem excusat.	legal maxim			Ignorance of a law which every man is bound to know is no excuse.

1903	Ignorent populi, si non in morte probaris, An scires adversa pati.		Lucan		The people would be ignorant, if you did not prove by your death that you were capable of supporting adversity.

1904	Ignoscas aliis multa, nil tibi.		Ausonius		Pardon others for many an offence, yourself for none.	
1905	Ignoscent si quid peccavero stultus amici, Inque vicem illorum patiar delicta libenter.		Horace		If I, in my foolishness, commit any offence, let my friends pardon it; I, in my turn, will willingly bear with their failings.

1907	Ignoti nulla cupido.	proverb			There can be no desire for that which is unknown.	Our wants are very much increased by knowledge and example.
1908	Ignotis errare locis, ignota videre Flumina gaudebat, studio minuente laborem.		Ovid		He loved to wander over unknown spots, and to see unknown rivers, his curiosity lessening the fatigue.	
1909	Ignotum argenti pondus et auri.		Virgil		An untold weight of silver and gold.	
1910	Ignotum per ignotius.	proverb			A thing not understood by a thing still less understood.	An attempt at illustration which only adds to the previous obscurity.
1911	Iis qui vendunt, emunt, conducunt, locant, justitia necessaria est.		Cicero		Justice is necessary for those who sell, who buy, who hire, and who let on contract.

1913	Illa dolet vere quae sine teste dolet.		Martial		She grieves sincerely who grieves when alone.	
1914	Illa est agricolae messis iniqua suo.		Ovid		That is a harvest which ill repays its husbandman.	
1915	Illa laus est, magno in genere et in divitiis maximis, Liberos hominem educare, generi monumentum et sibi.		Plautus		'Tis some merit for a man of noble family and of ample wealth to bring up children, memorials of his race and himself.	
1916	Illa placet tellus in qua res parva beatum Me facit, et tenues luxuriantur opes.		Martial		That spot has its especial delights, in which small means render me happy, and moderate wealth insures abundance.	
1917	Illa victoria viam ad pacem patefecit.				By that victory he opened a way to peace.	
1918	Illaeso lumine solem.				[To look] at the sun with sight uninjured.	Eagles are said to be able to do so. This is the
1919	Illam, quicquid agit, quoquo vestigia flectit, Componit furtim, subsequiturque decor.		Tibullus		In whatever she does, wherever she turns, grace steals into her movements, and attends her steps.	So Milton: "Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, In every gesture dignity and love." Par. Lost, viii.
1920	Ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit, hic diadema.		Juvenal		This man found the cross the reward of his crime; that one, a diadem.	History shows us how some men have gained a throne by the same steps which led others to the gallows.
1921	Ille etiam caecos instare tumultus Saepe monet, fraudesque et operta tumescere bella.		Virgil		He often warns too that secret revolt is impending, and that treachery and pent-up warfare are ready to burst forth.	The duty of a skilful statesman.
1922	Ille fidem dictis addere sola potest.		Ovid		It is that [the intention] alone that is able to give weight to what we say.	
1923	Ille fuit vitae Mario modus, omnia passo Quae pejor fortuna potest, atque omnibus uso Quae melior.		Lucan		Such was the course of Marius' life, who suffered all that ill fortune could inflict, and enjoyed all that good fortune could bestow.	Marius experienced, perhaps, more vicissitudes than any man we read of in history. See Plutarch's Life of him.
1924	Ille igitur nunquam direxit brachia contra Torrentem; nec civis erat qui libera posset Verba animi proferre, et vitam impendere vero.		Juvenal		He never exerted his arms to swim against the stream, nor was he a citizen who would freely deliver the sentiments of his mind, and lay down his life for the truth.	
1925	Ille potens sui Laetusque degit, cui licet in diem Dixisse, Vixi: cras vel atra Nube polum pater occupato Vel sole puro; non tamen irritum Quodcunque retro est efficiet.		Horace		The man is master of himself, and lives happy, who has it in his power to say, 'I have lived today; tomorrow let the Omnipotent invest the heavens, either with black clouds, or with clear sunshine, still, he shall not efface what is past.'	
1926	Ille sinistrorsum, hic dextrorsum, abit: unus utrique Error, sed variis illudit partibus.		Horace		One digresses to the right, the other to the left; they are both equally in error, but are influenced by different delusions.	
1927	Ille tenet palmam; palma petenda mihi est.				He holds the palm; the palm must be sought by me.	
1928	Ille terrarum mihi praeter omnes Angulus ridet.		Horace		That little spot of earth has charms for me before all others.	The charms of home.
1929	Ille vir, haud magna cum re, sed plenus fidei.				He is a man, not of ample means, but full of good faith.	
1930	Illi inter sese magna vi brachia tollunt.		Virgil		The workmen lift their arms in turns with mighty force.	Said of the Cyclopes, working at the forges of Etna. This line, when scanned, is expressive of the sound of alternate strokes on the anvil: Illin | ter se | se mag | na vi | brachia | tollunt — by the figure Onomatopoea. See a similar instance in Quadrupedante putrem, &c.
1931	Illi mors gravis incubat, Qui, notus nimis omnibus, Ignotus moritur sibi.		Seneca		Death falls heavily upon him, who, too well known to all others, dies unknown to himself.

1934	Illic apposito narrabis multa Lyaeo.		Ovid		There, with the wine on the table, you will tell many a story.

1938	Illud amicitiae sanctum ac venerabile nomen Nunc tibi pro vili sub pedibusque jacet?		Ovid		Is the sacred and venerable name of friendship now held cheap by you, and trodden under foot?	
1939	Illud maxime rarum genus est eorum, qui aut excellenti ingenii magnitudine, aut praeclara eruditione atque doctrina, aut utraque re ornati, spatium deliberandi habuerunt, quem potissimum vitae cursum sequi vellent.

1940	Imberbis juvenis tandem custode remoto Gaudet equis cunibusque, et aprici gramine campi, Cereus in vitium flecti, monitoribus asper, Utilium tardus provisor, prodigus aeris, Sublimis, cupidusque, et amata relinquere pernix.		Horace		The beardless youth, his tutor at length dismissed devotes himself to horses and hounds, and the sward or the sunny Campus Martius; pliable as wax in receiving bad impressions, impatient of admonition, slow to see what is really for his good, profuse of money, high-spirited and full of eagerness, and prone to abandon tin objects of his recent affection.	
1941	Immensum gloria calcar habet.		Ovid		Glory affords an unbounded stimulus.

1947	Imperat aut servit collecta pecunia cuique.		Horace		Money amassed either serves or rules us.	It becomes either a slave or a tyrant, according to the way in which it is employed.
1948	Imperia dura tolle, quid virtus erit?				Remove all harsh restraints, what will become of virtue?

2473	Luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras Imperio premit.		Virgil		He represses by his control the struggling winds, and the resounding tempests.	Said in allusion to the sway of Aeolus, the god of the winds.
2474	Lucus a non lucendo.					That is, Lucus, "a grove," is derived, by antiphrasis, from non lucere, "not to admit light," because, as the grammarians said, it does not allow the light of the sun to shine through it. This derivation is found in Servius on Aeneid I., Charisius, and Diomedes. Quintilian (i. 6) also notices it, but merely to ask whether such derivations from contraries can possibly be received by reasonable people; some critics having also imagined that ludus, "a school," was so called a non ludendo, because no play was allowed in it, and that Pluto was called Ditis, "rich," because he was minime dives, "not at all rich." Vossius condemns the derivation of lucus from luceo as a mere fancy of the grammarians, and alludes to another given by Isidore, xiv. 8, a collucendo crebris luminibus religionis causa, "from the number of lamps or torches that were often lighted in the sacred groves," lucus being properly a grove consecrated to some deity, though often used in a general sense. But Vossius prefers on the whole to derive it from λόχος, " an ambush." Others would have it for lugus from λύγη, " darkness." The real etymology is quite uncertain. Servius, who favours the derivation from luceo, adduces, in support of it, another imagination of the grammarians, bellum, "war," a nulla re bella, because it has nothing pleasing in it; and Varro, de L. L., book v., rather inclines to think that coelum, "heaven," may be derived a celando, from "to conceal," quia apertum est, "because it is open." Lucus a non lucendo has become proverbial in ridicule of absurd or far-fetched etymologies. See Non sequitur, and Obscurum per obscurius.

2480	Lupus in fabula.	proverb			The wolf in the fable.	Alluding to the accidental arrival of the person who happens at that moment to be the subject of conversation.

See Edere non poteris, &c.

2488	Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque secundis; Nec facile est aequa commoda mente pati.		Ovid		The feelings often run riot amid prosperity; and to bear good fortune with evenness of mind is no easy task.
